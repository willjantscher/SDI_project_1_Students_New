Functionality:
1. database mounts with postgressql, react runs on port 6001, all with docker-compose file



To go into Testing mode (with local database)
    in App.js   
        set port=testPort;
    // in package.json change the proxy from 6004 to 6003
    in queries.js    
        comment out user 
        comment out password
        change host to "localhost"
    brew services start postgresql
    set proxy in json to http://localhost:6004

Monday to do

0. make a get request that takes in the student name and password

1. add picture to profile and options to change picture, also store picture settings in database
    2. set up cookies to pass in student id and to retrieve student id when loading page
3. create gant chart for scheduling study stuff
4. save gant chart in database
5. dockerize whole project and push to docker hub

also add db queries to render and keep searching for the database periodically? every 1 sec or so?




CREATE two requests that will run on login
    one sets cookie
    the other will send back the info



responses are not parsing in react




2. get dockerize to work with proxy


6. gant chart
Set proxy in the React app’s package.json file with the server container’s service name and port
